<h1 class="title">Hello World</h1>
</header>
<p>Its October 2020, COVID-19 has wreaked havoc across the globe, the US
is deeply divided along partisan lines, the environment is in collapse,
the government is in a seemingly endless consitutional crisis, and I've
decided to start blogging! What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>My main goal here is to document my various projects. I suspect this
will mostly be a technical blog presenting my work on functional
programming, math, and philsophy, but I expect to also include reports
on garden, mycology, carpentry, and whatever other projects I get around
to finishing.</p>
<p>If you are wondering why you are reading this, allow me to elaborate
on who I am. My name is Solomon. I have worn many hats such as art
fabricator, free school organizer, community radio station
founder/manager, permaculture gardener, and most recently software
engineer.</p>
<p>My main interest in software development and computer science is
trying to understand the connection between functional programming,
math, and philosophical logic. This is a deep topic which I am only
starting to scratch the surface on, but I hope to use this platform to
dive deeper.</p>
